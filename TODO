Final Project Plans:
    ☐ Improve the way the hand looks (cards spread out and at different angles)
    ☐ More cards
    ☐ Add the ability to inspect a card, either by
        ☐ Clicking on it
        Or
        ☐ Hovering over it (this might be easier to do, and feels more natural to me)

Final Project Rubric:
    ☐ the game runs as expected with no major bugs
    ☐ code is organized and all debug comments have been removed
    ☐ the game is a clear improvement from Project 3
    ☐ the postmortem meaningfully addresses the questions (this isn't an English class, but I want to get the sense that you've actually reflected on it all)

Todo at end of project:
    ☐ Get rid of debug comments
    ☐ Go through comments for TODOs
    ☐ Write README when programming done
    ☐ fix font creation
